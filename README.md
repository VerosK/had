# HAD

A snake game. Study for a beginners' workshop.

Note that this is NOT a workshop.
It's a personal experiment in what would be easy to explain, what needs to be taught, what's OK to leave out.

## Spritesheet

Sprites are [automatically](./make_sprites.py) generated from a [vector file](./sprites.svg):

![Master vector](./sprites.svg)

... into a [spritesheet](./sprites.png) designed for easy lookup:

![Spritesheet](./sprites.png)

... from which the game then draws individual “tiles”:
